# Simple-Calculator App

My practice Application for REACT components and REACT events, like Mouse click or Keyboard button press. It's the calculator for simple math functions.

I used webpack to host it on your local machine as soon as you download the app from the github.

#### To start the application:

1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed on your computer
2. Run the command to set up the npm packages : `npm i`
3. Start the application with the coomand: `yarn dev-server` . It will give you the link to localhost, on my computer it is "http://localhost:8080/"
